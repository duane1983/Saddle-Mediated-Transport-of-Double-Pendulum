# This folder contains code for the PCR3BP and Double Pendulum tube analysis.

## This folder contains following sub-folders:
- Functions: This folder contains function file needed by the PCR3BP and double pendulum to calculate periodic orbits, tube manifolds, etc.
- Figures: This folder is used to store the figures generated by the plotting function.
- Results: This folder is used to store the calculation result. Those calculation result will be used to generate figures.
- Image: This folder contains image files needed for plotting.

## The following coding files are used for the analysis of PCR3BP:
- Functions\TubeFunctionTBP.jl: This file contains all the function needed by the PCR3BP.
- TBP_CalculateTubesPO.jl: This file is used to generate the stable and unstable manifold periodic orbits of PCR3BP problem.
- TBP_GeneratePO_Family.jl: This file is used to generate the periodic orbits of PCR3BP at different energy level.
- TBP_GenerateMonoMatrix.jl: This file is used to generate the monodromy matrix for the PCR3BP. This files needs to be run first in order to calculate the manifold of PCR3BP.
- TTBP_CalculateTubes.jl: This file is used to calculate the stable and unstable tube structures of the PCR3BP. Its calculation result is used to plot the homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits shown in Fig.4 and 5 in the paper.
