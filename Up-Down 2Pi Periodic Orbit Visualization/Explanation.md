# This folder contains file that illustrates how the special 2Pi periodic orbits that lives inside the intersection of Up-Down stable and unstable manifold looks like.

The following figure illustrates what will happen if we flow the unstable tube of Up-Down saddle repeatedly. If we flow the unstable manifold for infinitely many times, there will appear a special periodic orbit that always stays inside the intersection of stable and unstable manifold of Up-Down saddle. This point is indicated using a blue dot. This point represents the intersection of a special 2 Pi periodic trajectory with the Poincare plane. This special 2 Pi periodic orbit's motion is illustrated in file "EDoublePendulum_PO2_UpDownPeriodic_2Pi_Animate.mp4", and it represnt the continuous one-sided full rotation of the first pendulum arm.
